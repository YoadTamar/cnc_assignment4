## General Description
This is assignment 4 in "Communication and Computing" Course course at Ariel University.
We were asked to implement a ping program.
- in the first part we were ask to implement a simple ping: <br>
  The user will run the program (ping.c) with the ip. The program will send an ICMP ECHO REQUEST to the host, and when receiving ICMP-ECHOREPLY, the program will send the next ICMP ECHO REQUEST (no need to stop). 
  This code can't handle timeout, and it will just wait till it gets back reply.
- in the second part we were ask to implement a "better" ping:
   The user will run the program (better_ping.c) with the ip. It will do the same thing as before, but now we will handle the timeout.
   The better ping will run a second program that hold a timer (TCP connection on port 3000) to ensure that if we don‚Äôt receive an ICMP-ECHO-REPLY after sending an ICMP-REQUEST for 10 seconds, It will exit and print ‚Äúserver <ip> cannot be reached.‚Äù




## ConcreteMember
Implements the `Member` interface which describes the recipient of the updates (Observer). <br>
The class contains a copy (sallow copy) of the `UndoableStringBuilder`. 

ConcreteMember has 2 private variables:
-  `String name` 
- `UndoableStringBuilder usb`

  
in addition, has the following methods:
- `ConcreteMember`
- `update`
- `toString`


### ConcreteMember(String name)
Assigns the name of the member, and creates the UbdoableStringBuilder "usb".

### update(UndoableStringBuilder usb)
When GroupAdmin object sends an update, it will update `usb` to the GroupAdmin's `UndoableStringBuilder` , and made with a sallow copy.

### toString()
return the name and what `usb` contains.

## GroupAdmin

implements the `Sender` interface which 
Describes the sender of the updates (Observable). 
It contains the state (`UndoableStringBuilder`) 
and a members who should receive updates on any changes made.


GroupAdmin has 2 private variables: 
- `UndoableStringBuilder usb`
- `List<Member> members`

  
in addition, has the following methods:
- `GroupAdmin`
- `register`
- `unregister`
- `insert`
- `append`
- `delete`
- `undo`
- `notifyObservers`
- `toString`


### GroupAdmin()
Assigns `usb` and creates the ArrayList `members`.

### register(Member obj)
It used to register observers. each member can register only once! (if he didn't unregister). 

### unregister(Member obj)
It used to unregister observers. each member can unregister only if he already register. 

### insert(int offset, String obj)
inserts "obj" string into `usb` from the position "offset". 

### append(String obj)
It use to appends "obj" string to `usb`.

### delete(int start, int end)
It use to delete from `usb` the substring starting at "start" and ending at "end" (not included).

### undo()
Erases the last change done in `usb` and reverts it to the previous state it was at.

### notifyObservers()
notify to each member(Observe), with the `update` method.

### toString()
Returns `members` list; (toString for each member).


## Run The Project And Tests 

#### To open the project:

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YoadTamar/OOP_Assignment1
```
#### To run the test

Open the project 

open src directory

Open test directory

For test of memory - run the `Tests` class

For test of the classes open observer directory

and choose the class you want to test - ConcreteMember or GroupAdmin.

## Tests

The test made with JUnit 5.
We test two thing - the memory and the correctness of the classes.

We test the memory with `JvmUtilities` and `pom.xml` which implemets the `JOL` interface.

We test the classes `ConcreteMember` and `GroupAdmin` methods.
For each method we create his own test.

#### For example - memory:

#### For example - method:
